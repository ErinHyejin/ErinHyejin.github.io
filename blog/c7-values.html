      <h1>Value and Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <h2>Affection</h2>
      <h3>Feb 5, 2015</h3>
 
      <p> When I think of the times in my life where I have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, "affection, close relationships, courage, cooperation, excitement, and wisdom" come to mind. <br><br>

      Among them, if I have to choose one value, that will be affection. I am a person who is very social and extrovert. It is very important for me to feel loved and cared by others. If I do not have people to share my achievement, though I achieve something big, it is nothing for me.<br><br>

      When I think about my values, most of them are related to relationships - it can be with family, friends, and anyone who is related to my life. When I feel stereotype threat or feel down, meeting people who are reliable, warm-hearted, and supportive will be the best thing to do. Talking about how I feel and receiving couraging feedback will help me to overcome troubles. <br><br>
