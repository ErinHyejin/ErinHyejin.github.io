      <p> Continue to the ruby class basic blog article, I am going to talk more about ruby class, including class methods and class variables, today. <br><br>

      <h4>Getter, Setter, Attributes</h4>
      1. Getter: when you return a variable using a method, getter is used. <br>

      <figure>
        <img src="imgs/oop0.png"> 
        <figcaption>Figure 1. Getter</figcaption>
      </figure>

      In Figure 1, after initialize method, I create get_name method to return @name. When I call mydog.get_name, it returns "Lulu".  

      2. Setter: when you change a variable, method_name=(argument) is used. Let's look at the example below. 

       <figure>
        <img src="imgs/oop1.png"> 
        <figcaption>Figure 2. Setter</figcaption>
      </figure>

      In line 15, I created mydog named "Lulu", but I called set_name method to change the name to "Brian." Then, when I printed mydog.get_name in line 18, it became "Brian."       (I attached the console below the codes to show the result.) <br><br>

      However, when you want to call or change several variables, creating methods for each takes too much time. To solve the problem, we can use attributes. <br><br>

      3. Attributes: There are three different attributes we can use instead of getter, setter methods. <br>
      i)  attr_reader :name 
      ii) attr_writer :name 
      iii) attr_accessor :name 

      <figure>
        <img src="imgs/oop2.png"> 
        <figcaption>Figure 3. Attributes</figcaption>
      </figure>

      In line 2, I added "attr_reader :name" and commented out get_name method from line 8 to 10. Since attr_reader :variable creates getter method for the variable, we can simply call mydog.name in line 18 to get a result "Lulu." We can add many variables with commas like this: <b>"attr_reader :name, :age, :breed</b><br><br>

      In the same way, "attr_writer" can be used instead of setter method, and "attr_accessor" for both getter and setter methods.<br><br> 

      <h4>Class Method</h4>
      So far, to call a method in a class, we had to create a new instance (e.g)mydog) and provide information for arguments. However, class method can be called without instances. The difference from instance method is adding 'self.' in front of method name. 

      <figure>
        <img src="imgs/oop3.png"> 
        <figcaption>Figure 4. Class Method</figcaption>
      </figure>

      In figure 4, you may notice a class method, self.make_bark. In line 12, without creating a new instance for Dog class, I call make_bark using class name 'Dog.' Since the method is for the class, we cannot call it with instance_name.method. Assuming we have mydog instance named "Lulu," mydog.make_bark will not work.  

      <h4>Class Variable</h4>
      Different from instance variable (@variable_name), class variable has '@@' in front of its name (e.g)@@count). Let's look at the code below. 

      <figure>
        <img src="imgs/oop4.png"> 
        <figcaption>Figure 5. Class Variable</figcaption>
      </figure>

      In line 2, there's a class variable @@count = 0. It is returned in self.count method in line 9. Since the count method is a class method, we can call it with the class name Dog. <br><br>

      In line 19 and in line 23, I created mydog instance and yourdog instance each. When I called 'mydog.bark', the result is "lulu bow wow!". <br><br>

      Similar to class methods, we cannot call it with instance_name.method. So, I called Dog.count in line 21 and the result is "1" as terminal shows. <br><br>

      When yourdog and mydog bark one time each in line 24 and 27, the terminal shows @@count value 2 and three as Dog.count result. It means, regardless of instance, the @@count value increases when instance.bark is called. <br><br>
