    <h4>Array</h4>
     
     <p> 
      <b>Array</b> is ordered collections of data. <br><br>
      It looks like this: [ ] <br>
      When you make an empty array, just type
      "array_name = []" as you see on the right
      in your text editor.
      <figure><img  src = "imgs/array0.png"><figcaption>Creating a new array called "words"</figcaption></figure>
       

    </p>   
       When we call a specific data, we can use index. From the beginning, index 0, index number increments by 1. 
    </p>

      <figure><img src = "imgs/array1.png"><figcaption>Creating an array "words" and pulling out the data </figcaption></figure>
      
      <figure><img src = "imgs/array1_res.png"><figcaption>result</figcaption><figure>


    <p>
       Also, a negative index is used to call data from the end of the array. For example, 
    </p>

     <figure><img src = "imgs/array2.png"><figcaption>Pulling out the data using negative index</figcaption></figure>

     <figure><img src = "imgs/array2_res.png"><figcaption>result</figcaption><figure>

    <p>
       array[-1] = 'Desk' 
       array[-2] = 'Cookie' 
       array[-3] = 'Bread'
       array[-4] = 'Air'
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to select the last item in the array and do not know how many items are in the array, just use a negative index. 
    </p>

    <p>What is you want to add items in an array? It is simple! 
     <b>array.push item_name</b> or <b>array[specific_index] = item_name </b>


    <p>
    Though array is useful in many ways, it is not good for searching an item from tremendous amount of data. To search the item, we should go over the array one by one, which takes long time. Is there any alternative way? Yes, it is <b>hash</b>! 
    </p>

    <h4>Hash</h4>
    <p> 
       A hash looks like this: { }<br>
       A hash is a collection of key-value pairs and the pairs are not ordered lists. In other words, you cannot use index to pull out specific data from a hash. 
       <br><br>

       Creating a new empty hash is simple: 
       "hash_name = {}"
       When you want to insert a certain pair in the hash, simply type "hash_name [key] = value". 
      <figure><img src= "imgs/hash0.png"> 
      <figcaption>Hash: how many cookies you can it</figcaption></figure>
      <figure><img src= "imgs/hash0_res.png"><figcaption> Result of the code </figcaption></figure>
    </p>

    <p>
    To search specific data, instead of using index, use keys. For example, if you want to call a specific data, call it with a key that matches with the value. Let's look at the hash named "cookie" we created above and search how many cookies we can eat on Tuesday.  
    </p>

     
    <figure><img src= "imgs/hash1.png"><figcaption>   How to call a specific data?</figcaption></figure>

    <figure><img src= "imgs/hash1_res.png"><figcaption> Result: we can eat five cookies on Tuesday. </figcaption></figure> 

     <p>
    Since hash doesn't save data in an order, we need to use array when we want to sort data. We can choose keys or values in a hash and make an array in a simple way:

    Type <b>hash.keys</b> or <b>hash.values</b>
    </p>

    <figure><img src= "imgs/hash2.png"><figcaption>   Making arrays (keys/values) from a hash</figcaption></figure>

    <figure><img src= "imgs/hash2_res.png"><figcaption> Result in Terminal</figcaption></figure> 

    <p>
    Let's look at the image files "Making arrays (keys/values) from a hash" and the "Result in Terminal." I puts cookie.keys and all the keys are printed in the terminal : Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. <br>
    After the blank line, I called cookie.keys[0], which means "call the first datum in the array named cookie.keys." Can you guess the result? As you see the result in terminal, it is "Monday."
    <br>
    The next code I requested to the computer is "cookie.values," which selects all the values in the hash "cookie." Can you see the result in terminal? The array has [3, 5, 2]. After creating the array cookie.values, I called the a datum using index[2]. As a result, '2' was printed in terminal.    
    <br><br>
    It is easy to use arrays and hashes, isn't it? 
    There are many methods which make arrays and hashes useful and convenient to use. Hope you enjoy using those two in programming. 
    <br>
