      <h4>Pair Programming</h4>
      <p>
        When I started DevBootcamp course, I did not have sense of belonging that I was a member of 2015 cohort. The only thing that made me to feel I was not alone goint through this journey was having pair programmings. <br><br>
 
        Overall, pair programming is fun for me. I learn new skills and different ways to solve a problem. In addition, applying what I've learned so far and explaining how I approach a problem to a pair give me a chance to review my knowledge. That also helps me find what is not clear for me.<br><br> 

        However, learning and working on the same project remotely are not easy for me, especially as a foreigner. Something frustrating for me is expressing my thoughts and explaining code in English. Though I have a strong concept, sometimes it takes long time for me to express what I want to do clearly. Luckily, all pairs I have met so far were kind, and they communicated well to understand my thoughts. <br><br>
       
        In addition, it is hard to stick to one role (driver/navigator) during a half of the session because the knowledge level on the specific project is different from pair to pair. Though my role is a navigator for the first half of the session, it is necessary to switch the role in case I don't understand programming directions. In addition, switching roles is somewhat hard if we are so into working on the codes. Of course, switching roles smoothly is necessary for all programmers, so I will practice it more in the next pairing sessions.<br><br>

      <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p>
       So far, I received about 10+ feedbacks. I feel good when I get good feedbacks. The members of my cohorts are very kind and communicate with care. Most feedbacks helped me to learn what to improve. Based on the feedbacks, next time, I will drive more than navigate. <br><br>
       
      Since it is written in English, sometimes I feel it is difficult to write a kind and specific feedback. I don't want to complain to the pair or make any sensitive feedback, but I have hard time to choose right words and right expressions. In addition, since I met good pairs so far, there was less things to give specific, actionable comments for them to improve. I think one peer pairing and one guided pairing session is good for me.
