      After watching the video, I realized that I should be more active and self-motivated than I expected at DBC. Without any experience, I somewhat expected that DBC will work as a traditional school. However, it was more like building something by ourselves. Rather than being a consumer, I need to be more passionate, grab my experience, and take control of my program.

      Going through the first week, I felt everyone was smarter than me and they seemed to go through the curriculum so fast and smooth. I wanted to give up, doubting my ability to survive in this program. However, after chatting with some members of my cohort and watching the video, I found that I was not the only one who felt like this. Though it is somewhat competitive environment, we have each other who is willing to help and work together.

      I decided not to worry about my ignorance and keep in mind that the knowledge difference between me and other people is not that big. I will expose my ignorance, ask helps, and enjoy the process of learning itself. With humble attitude, I will focus on learning new things and overcoming each challenge.
