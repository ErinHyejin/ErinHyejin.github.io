      <h1>The quality of human Life is diminishing</h1>
      <h2>One of the problems Tech World is now facing</h2>
      <h3>Jan 14, 2015</h3>
 
      <h4>What are you looking at during the most of your time in a day?</h4>
      <p>
        #1. There are two people dating at a restaurant and they use smartphones while eating, without conversation.<br><br>
        #2. A person is busy taking pictures and uploading them to SNS during a trip. He/she does not have enough time to enjoy the scenery there because he/she sees the screen of a smartphone all the time. <br><br>
        #3. A guy who spent 10 hours in front of a computer at work plays mobile game using a smartphone at home until going to bed.  <br><br>

        Isn't it similar to our lives? Yes, our eyes are stuck to screens all day long.

      <h4>In Tech world, quality of human interaction is diminishing</h4>
      
      <p><b>1. Spending more and more time staring at screen</b> <br><br>
      It is surprising to know how many hours per day we spend in front of screens. In addition to TV, the internet and smartphone usage have increased tremendously. Let's look at the chart below that shows average minutes people spend everyday looking at screens. The chart is from Annual State of the Internet presentation by Mary Meeker, who is an internet analyst at Morgan Stanley.

      </figure>
         
      In the United States, people use 147 minutes watching TV, 103 minutes using computers, 151 minutes using smartphones, and 43 minutes using tablets in average. In total, it is 444 minutes which is almost 7.4 hours a day. In addition, you may add extra 7+ hours to this minutes if you work with the computer. <br><br>

      We are forgetting that there are more meaningful ways to spend a day other than staring at screens. <br><br>


      <b>2. Too many interactions, but lack of real contact with people and society </b><br><br>

      Now, people interact with others all the time via smartphones and internet. However, at the same time, due to using long hours in front of screens, people have less time to interact with each other in person. It is now common staying at home for days or weeks, having no communication with others including family and friends. Even at work, people communicate with coworkers using messangers and emails. <br><br>  

      According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology social psychologist Sherry Turkle, PhD,<br>
         
      "People today are more connected to one another than ever before in human history, thanks to Internet-based social networking sites and text messaging. But they’re also more lonely and distant from one another in their unplugged lives. This is not only changing the way we interact online, it’s straining our personal relationships, as well." <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/06/social-networking.aspx"> (American Psychological Association) </a><br><br>

      The next generation will be more familiar with interacting with computers than with people. Even babies are exposed to screens all around the house and easily from early age, and focus on how to use tech tools. Some babies already spend more time with screens than other people except a caregiver.

      <b>3. Health Issues </b><br><br>

      Though technology brought convenience in our lives, we have more workload. Because of flood of information such as tons of emails, SNS posts, subscriptions, and notifications, people get exhausted and stressed out. Even worse, unnecessary works such as filtering email list, managing information, and responding to a lot of requests have added on top of the busy daily schedule, which occupies our time to relax. People may experience burnout more frequently. <br><br>

      When we have free time, we prefer stay in a couch and play online/mobile game not moving much, which leads physical weakness. The growth of online game market infers that people are engaged to play more online games nowadays. There are many studies found a relationship between our health and this screen-centered life style and more and more health issues arise.  <br><br>
      </p>

      <h4>How to solve this problem?</h4>

      <p>It is impossible to live without internet, computers, and smartphones. However, we can take a break by planning making tech-free, smartphone free, or internet free days. There are many blogs that suggest how to spend a day meaningfully without screens. Our brain and eyes need to be free to see other things, not stick to screens. There are apps such as 'Checky' that allow us know how often we check smartphones and how long we spend time on it. In the future, more technologies will be available that protect us from possible problems caused by this life style, and that reduce stress and revitalize tired people. We should always think about what technology is for.
