      <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <h2>Women in Computer Field</h2>
      <h3>Jan 28, 2015</h3>
 
      <h4>As a woman, can I really be a successful programmer?</h4>
      <p>
        Before I came to California, I never ever thought of programmer as a career for me. Unconsciously, like many other people, I deeply believed that men were much better working with computer and technology.<br><br>

        Therefore, it took me a long time to decide to study programming language and algorithm last year. It had been more than a year since I moved to California in March, last year, and I knew that being an engineer was awesome. However, I did not want to take a risk studying totally different subject from what I have learned which was English literature and linguistics. Now, I found that one of the reasons I thought about computer science in that way was 'stereotype threat.'<br><br>

        I know the stereotype threat "software engineer is considered as a men profession" affected to my performance and thinking process.Even before trying studying, I was worried about my ability to learn programming and get a job. When I started study, though it was hard to everyone to learn new things, I wanted to give up. Whenever I got stuck, rather thinking "this problem is difficult," I thought that I was not good at studying computer science. <br><br>
 
        I found the same worry I have from twitter feed a few days ago.

        As ane says, sometimes it is very hard to overcome the stereotype threat and we tend to think too much of it. However, Emma's reply is simple, "become an engineer." That's simple response, but very important.<br><br> 

        Recently, Silicon Valley companies hire more women engineers and encourage women to study computer science. The stereotype is not strictly believed. Therefore, my challenge is, just keep going to be an engineer, not feeling frustrated by stereotype that is in my mind. In addition, I will encourage other women who study programming especially in my DBC cohort. When we show the world that there are excellent women engineers like us and there are more women in tech companies, this stereotype threat will be reduced and disappear eventually.
