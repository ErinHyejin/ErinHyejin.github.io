    <h4>My Thinking Style</h4>
    <p>
       When I took <a target= "_blanc" href=http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html>the Thinking Style test</a>, I found my thinking styles are <b>concrete sequential (CS)</b> and <b>abstract sequential (AS)</b>. My CS and AS scores were both very high: 42 and 40 each.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The test result indicates that, <br>

       - I use my five senses - sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing <b>(Concrete)</b><br>

      - as well as intuition and imagination <b>(Abstract)</b> when I think.<br>

      - In addition, I strongly prefer thinking in an ordered, sequential, and linear way <b>(Sequential)</b>. <br><br> 

      I always plan ahead because working without plan makes me uncomfortable. I also enjoy dividing big chunk of a task into pieces to avoid working on several project at the same time and feeling overwhelmed. It helps me to achieve small goals for a day and focus on 'now and here' instead of being distracted by other projects.

      <h4>How Have I been for the Last Three Weeks? </h4>

      <p>
      It's been three weeks since I started <b>Dev Bootcamp</b> phase 0 curriculum. I felt overwhemled in the beginning when I saw 10+ challenges in a folder per week with lots of resources to read. Therefore, I reviewed all the challenges in the beginning of each week and set a goal for the day. In this way, instead of being worried about the deadline scanning all the challenges everytime I work, I could focus on the work for the day. 

      I feel excited when I finish the goal at the end of a week.

      <h4>My Two Big Struggles</h4>

      <b>Discussions</b><br>
      I understand that discussions and Q&A sessions are helpful to learn something, but I feel less comfortable because of two major reasons: <br>
      1. I prefer taking well organized lectures and studying by myself.<br>
      2. It is very hard to express my thoughts and opinions in English which is not my first language. When I communicate in pair programming sessions, it was difficult to explain clearly what I want to. <br><br>

      <b>Too much resources to read</b><br>
      In addition, there are so many articles I should read in this curriculum. I always try to check all the suggested materials. If there are many extra sources, I feel overwhemlmed. Because reading in English takes long time and it is hard to get the focal point and remember the contents. I find images, graphs, maps, and charts are more helpful materials for me. I like visual materials which I can see a big picture and flow.

      <br><br>

      However, I understand any form of materials have their own strength and weakness. Because my learning style is multimodal, I can adjust my learning style according to different learning method. When I train myself to work in random situations, I will do my best to adapt to the situation in my life. I will adjust myself to any kind of learning styles with a growth mindset.
