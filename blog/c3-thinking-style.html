       When I took <a target= "_blanc" href=http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html>Thinking Style test</a>, my thinking style is both concrete sequential (CS) and abstract sequential (AS). 
       I use my five senses - sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing- as well as intuition and imagination. Since my CS and AS scores were 42 and 40 each,

      I strongly prefer ordered, sequential, and linear way. I always plan ahead and it makes me uncomfortable to do something without plan. I enjoy dividing big chunk of task into pieces for a day and achieving a goal. 

      It's been three weeks since I started DBC phase 0. Because DBC divides each challenges and set a goal for a week, I feel excited when I finish the goal at the end of a week.

      <b>My two big struggles</b>
      For me, it is very hard to express my thoughts and opinions in English which is not my mother tongue. When I communicate in pair programming session, explaining subtle difference and positioning that I want to make was very difficult. 

      In addition, there are so many articles I should read. I have strong feeling to check all the suggested materials, so that if there are many extra sources, I feel overwhemlmed. Because reading in English takes long time and it is hard to get the focal point and remember the contents. Helpful materials for me are like images, graphs, maps, and charts.    
      
      My learning style is multimodal. Therefore, I tend to adjust my learning mode according to different learning method. 

      I like visual materials which I can see a big picture and flow. 

      Discussion and Q&A sessions are somewhat helpful, but if they are not organized. I prefer taking lectures or studying by myself. 

      My productivity increases when I attend schools and academies where my schedule is planned ahead.    

      However, I understand any form of materials have their own pros and cons. I will adjust myself to any kind of learning styles.
