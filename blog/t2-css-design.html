      <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
      <h2>What are the differences between static, fixed, relative, and absolute positioning?</h2>
      <h3>Dec 30, 2014</h3>
 
      <p>
        CSS positioning is a useful property to make complex layouts on your page. However, it is not easy to understand how different positioning works, especially for css beginners. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's figure out how to position elements using different positioning. CSS has 4 positioning methods: static, relative, absolute, and fixed positioning. I created an html file and will go through one by one.
      </p>
      
      <figure>
        <img src="imgs/positioning_html.png">
        <figcaption> Figure 0. Positioning.html</figcaption>
      </figure>

      

      <h4>1. Static positioning</h4>
        <figure>
        <img src="imgs/static.png">
        <figcaption> Figure 1. Static Positioning</figcaption>
      </figure>


        <p>
          If you do not specify elements' positioning, HTML elements are positioned static by default, which means the elements occurs where it would normally in the document. 
        </p>

        <P>
          As you see in Figure 0, I put elements in order of "A", "A1" in "A", "B", and "C". According to the order in the html file, each element occurs in the browser. I did not set any position for all those elements for now.   
        </P>


      <h4>2. Fixed positioning</h4>
        <p>
          When an element has fixed positioning, it is positioned relative to the browser window, and always stays in the same place even though we scroll down the window. 
        
        </p>
        <figure>
         <img src="imgs/fixed_html.png">
          <figcaption> Figure 2-1. Fixed.css</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Blue square (C) on the top-right side has fixed position, and you can see it does not move even though I scrolled down.  
        </p>  

        <figure>
         <img src="imgs/fixed.png">
          <figcaption> Figure 2-2. Fixed Positioning</figcaption>
        </figure>



        <figure>
         <img src="imgs/fixed1.png">
          <figcaption> Figure 2-3. Fixed Positioning after scrolling down</figcaption>
       </figure>

        
        
         
        <p> 
          However, fixed positioning is not supported well in some mobile browsers.
        </p>  





      <h4>3. Relative positioning</h4>
        <p> 
          When you specify "position: relative" in CSS and do not give any extra properties on the element, relative positioning is the same as static positioning.
        </p>
          
          However, by using top, right, bottom, and left, you can move the element relative to where it would have occured if it had the static positioning. Let's move the yellow box (A1). 
        </p>
        
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/relative_css.png">
        <figcaption> Figure 3-1. Relative.css</figcaption>
      </figure>
        
        <figure>
         <img src="imgs/relative.png">
        <figcaption> Figure 3-2. Relative Positioning</figcaption>
      </figure>
       

        <p> 
          Even though we moved the yellow box to the new location, the yellow box (A1) is considered that it still occupies its original space. 
        </p>

      <h4>4. Absolute positioning</h4>
        <p>
          When we set position: absolute on an element, the element is positioned in relation to the first parent element whch does not have static positioning. If there's no such element, the element with position: absolute gets positioned relative to <html>. 
        </p>

        <p> Let's first set position:absolute on yellow (A1) and green (B) box. 


        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/absolute0_css.png">
          <figcaption> Figure 4-1. Absolute.css</figcaption>
       </figure>


        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/absolute0.png">
          <figcaption> Figure 4-2. Absolute Positioning</figcaption>
       </figure>
       
        

        <p>
          Since there is no parent element which has other than static position, the yellow box and the green box moved based on the browser window.
        </p> 

        <p>
          However, I want to put the yellow box inside of the red box. To do this, we need to use position:relative and position:absolute. When I set relative position on the red box (A), any elements within A -in this case, yellow box (A1)- will move relative to A.  
        </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="imgs/absolute_css.png">
          <figcaption> Figure 4-3. Relative-Absolute Positioning.css</figcaption>
       </figure>
       

       <figure>
          <img src="imgs/absolute.png">
          <figcaption> Figure 4-4. Relative-Absolute Positioning</figcaption>
       </figure>
        

        
        <p>
          As you see in the screen shot, I set relative position on A and absolute position on A1. Contrary to figure 4-2, the yellow box is located within the red box. However, the green box is located in the same place. 
        </p>
